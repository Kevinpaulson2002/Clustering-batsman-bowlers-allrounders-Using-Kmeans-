This project employs the K-means algorithm to sort cricket players into three groups batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers, based on their past  performances.
The algorithm categorizes players into different groups based on metrics like batting average, bowling average, and strike rate analysis.
The clusters that are generated are then plotted on a graph, enabling us to easily observe how players are categorized according to their performance data.
This method uses data to classify cricket players and understand their team roles.
